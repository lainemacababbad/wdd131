            <h2>Helaman 3:27-29</h2>
            <p>Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call
                upon his holy name.
                Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name
                of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.
                Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which
                shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of
                Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf
                the wicked</p>

            <h2>Ether 3:14</h2>
            <p>Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus
                Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they
                who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.</p>
